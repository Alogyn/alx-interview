# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle 🔺

Welcome to the **Pascal's Triangle** project for the ALX Interview Preparation. In this project, you will implement an algorithm in Python to generate Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows.

## 📝 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- 🔢 **Understand Pascal's Triangle:** Learn how to generate Pascal’s Triangle, a triangular array where each number is the sum of the two directly above it.
- 🗂️ **Python Lists and List Comprehensions:** Revise how to create, access, modify, and iterate over lists. Use list comprehensions for concise and readable code.
- 🧠 **Functions and Recursion:** Understand how to define and call functions, pass parameters, and return values. Optional: use recursion for generating rows of the triangle.
- 🔄 **Loops and Conditional Statements:** Implement logic using loops and conditionals to handle edge cases, such as the first and last elements in each row.
- ➕ **Arithmetic Operations:** Perform addition, the essential operation for generating the elements of Pascal's Triangle.
- 🔢 **Indexing and Slicing:** Master accessing list elements and slices, crucial for summing up values to generate new rows.

## 📂 Project Structure

This project includes the following:

1. 🛠️ **Pascal's Triangle Function**
    - **File:** `0-pascal_triangle.py`
    - **Description:** Implements the `pascal_triangle(n)` function that returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascal's Triangle of size `n`. It returns an empty list if `n <= 0`.

2. 🧪 **Main File for Testing**
    - **File:** `0-main.py`
    - **Description:** Contains a test case that calls the `pascal_triangle()` function with `n = 5` and prints the triangle.
